### Discription
This project is a fully responsive React application that includes various features such as a side navigation bar, dynamic card components, interactive animations, and integration with the Chart.js library for data visualization. 
Additionally, it provides MetaMask wallet integration to manage wallet connection and display account information. 
The application utilizes Chakra UI for the side drawer component, which is hidden on small screens and accessible via a hamburger menu icon.

### Features
- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The side navigation bar is hidden on small screens, and a hamburger menu icon is displayed 
    to access the side drawer.
- Side Drawer with Chakra UI: Utilizes Chakra UI library to implement the side drawer component. The drawer is hidden by default on small screens and can be opened by clicking on the 
     hamburger menu icon.
- Side Navigation Bar: Displays navigation links and user profile information.
  Supports highlighting of active navigation item and dropdown menu.
- Dynamic Cards: Renders data fetched from an external API into dynamic card components.
   Each card displays asset information, including symbol, code, description, rate, and trade button.
- Interactive Animations: Utilizes Framer Motion library for animation effects, such as motion transitions and hover effects.
- Chart.js Integration: Utilizes Chart.js library for creating line charts and doughnut charts to visualize data fetched from external APIs.
- MetaMask Integration: Implements MetaMask wallet integration to connect and manage wallet accounts. Displays account information upon successful connection and provides feedback messages for connection status.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
